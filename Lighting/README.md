# Lighning System

The system can drive a NeoPixel Led strip or and an RGB Led strip. It features two rotary encoders with pushbuttons, one positioned below the other:

- "Level" knob (large): Adjusts brightness and toggles the light on and off with a fading effect.
- "Setting" knob (smaller): Changes the color temperature between warm-white and cool-white.
